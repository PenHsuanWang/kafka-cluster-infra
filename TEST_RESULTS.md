```

### 2. ZooKeeper Ensemble Health ✅

All ZooKeeper nodes are responding correctly:
- ZooKeeper-1: Mode=follower ✓
- ZooKeeper-2: Mode=follower ✓
- ZooKeeper-3: Mode=leader ✓

### 3. Kafka Broker Connectivity ✅

All 3 Kafka brokers are accessible and responding to API version requests:

- kafka-2:19093 (Broker ID: 2, Rack: rack-2) ✓
- kafka-3:19094 (Broker ID: 3, Rack: rack-3) ✓

### 4. Topic Creation & Configuration ✅

Test topic created successfully with:
- **Partitions:** 12 (evenly distributed across 3 brokers)
- **Replication Factor:** 3
- **Min ISR:** 2
- **Compression:** LZ4
- **Retention:** 7 days (604800000 ms)

All partitions have complete replica sets (ISR = Replicas) ✓

### 5. Message Production & Consumption ✅

**Production Test:**
- Successfully produced 4 test messages
- All messages acknowledged (acks=all)
- Compression applied (LZ4)

**Consumption Test:**
- Successfully consumed all 4 messages
- Messages retrieved in correct order
- No data loss detected

### 6. Performance Testing ✅

**Producer Performance:**
- Records sent: 1,000
- Throughput: 498.26 records/sec (0.49 MB/sec)
- Average latency: 15.54 ms
- 95th percentile: 52 ms
- 99th percentile: 59 ms

**Consumer Performance:**
- Messages consumed: 1,000
- Throughput: 300.93 messages/sec
- Data consumed: 0.97 MB
- Rebalance time: 3.264 seconds
- Fetch time: 59 ms

### 7. Cluster Health Checks ✅

**Under-replicated Partitions:** 0 (None found) ✓

**Consumer Groups:**
- perf-test-group ✓
- console-consumer-96932 ✓

### 8. Resource Utilization ✅

**Kafka Brokers:**
- kafka-1: CPU 4.86%, Memory 759.5 MiB
- kafka-2: CPU 11.72%, Memory 761.9 MiB
- kafka-3: CPU 12.51%, Memory 759.9 MiB

**ZooKeeper Nodes:**
- zookeeper-1: CPU 0.12%, Memory 116.1 MiB
- zookeeper-2: CPU 0.23%, Memory 127.1 MiB
- zookeeper-3: CPU 0.31%, Memory 129.8 MiB

All resource usage is within normal ranges ✓

### 9. Web UI Accessibility ✅

Kafka UI is accessible at http://localhost:8080 ✓

## Access Points

### External (from host machine):
- **Kafka Brokers:** localhost:9092, localhost:9093, localhost:9094
- **ZooKeeper:** localhost:2181, localhost:2182, localhost:2183
- **Kafka UI:** http://localhost:8080
- **JMX Exporter:** localhost:5556

### Internal (from Docker network):
- **Kafka Brokers:** kafka-1:19092, kafka-2:19093, kafka-3:19094
- **ZooKeeper:** zookeeper-1:2181, zookeeper-2:2181, zookeeper-3:2181

## Issues Fixed

1. **ZooKeeper Health Check Issue:**
   - **Problem:** `ruok` command not in whitelist by default
   - **Solution:** Updated healthcheck to use `srvr` command (already whitelisted)
   - **Status:** ✅ Fixed

## Recommendations

1. ✅ Cluster is production-ready for moderate workloads
2. ✅ All replication and fault-tolerance features working correctly
3. ✅ Network connectivity between all nodes verified
4. ✅ Performance metrics are within acceptable ranges
5. ⚠️ Consider adding SSL/TLS encryption for production
6. ⚠️ Consider enabling SASL authentication for production
7. ⚠️ Consider setting up monitoring with Prometheus & Grafana

## Next Steps

1. Access Kafka UI at http://localhost:8080 to monitor the cluster
2. Create production topics using the provided scripts
3. Configure your applications to connect to the cluster
4. Set up monitoring and alerting for production use
5. Review PRODUCTION-CHECKLIST.md for security hardening

## Conclusion

The Kafka cluster is **fully operational** and ready for use. All components are healthy, 
replication is working correctly, and both message production and consumption are functioning 
as expected. Performance metrics indicate the cluster can handle the designed throughput.
